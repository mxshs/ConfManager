# ConfManager
Made a tool for myself to automate configuration of various software (here I use very simple markdown to express config steps, planning to expand it to be more yaml-like).
Is there a reason to use this tool instead of ansible? No. Just made it for fun and to simplify things for myself only.
To be added later:
- Parallel jobs and commands inside jobs
- Extend config parser + code generation
- Probably move to a different cli framework (or write cli features from scratch)
